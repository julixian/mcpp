# requires: windows
# 703 -- the C++ runtime record of clang on the MSVC ABI (#649 E10, closed by
# #718). Kept at this number: the filename is now inexact (the row's DEFAULT
# is no longer the static CRT), and the fuller Windows leg of #718 lives at
# 814; this file keeps testing the one thing it always tested — what
# `resolution.json` records for the llvm row's C++ runtime contract.
#
# mcpp used to emit a CRT model (`/MT` or `/MD`) only for cl.exe. clang on the
# MSVC ABI received none, its driver linked the static CRT
# (`-defaultlib:libcmt`) regardless of what `cxx_runtime` said, and the table
# recorded `self-contained` for every request while an explicit `host-coupled`
# or `toolchain-coupled` printed that the row did not deliver it.
#
# Every MSVC-ABI row now receives the SAME model cl.exe does, spelled
# `-fms-runtime-lib=static`/`=dll` — one helper, `msvc_abi_crt_word` — reaching
# the compile line, the std/std.compat BMIs and the link command alike. The
# row's DEFAULT is therefore `toolchain-coupled` (the dynamic CRT, with the
# toolset's own vcruntime140.dll/msvcp140.dll staged beside the artifact),
# and an explicit `host-coupled` or `toolchain-coupled` is now delivered
# rather than degraded.
#
# Read only when the default toolchain on this runner is the llvm row: a
# runner whose default is msvc@system prints that and asserts nothing,
# because the cl.exe cells are unchanged and covered elsewhere.
