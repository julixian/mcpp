# 851 -- a member that two members of different configurations use is
# compiled once in each configuration, and never served across them.
#
# A workspace is one graph per configuration (workspace design 2026-09-29
# §2, §3): a node is a (package, configuration) pair. e2e 833 builds a member
# of another standard beside the others, but that member uses no shared one;
# this states what happens to a member both configurations reach, and what
# does not split a package into two nodes.
#
# Criteria:
#   A. `lib` is used by `app23` (C++23, with lib's feature `extra`) and by
#      `app26` (`standard = "c++26"`, without it). `--workspace` gives two
#      build directories; each compiles lib's object once; each program
#      prints its own configuration's `__cplusplus` and feature.
#   B. In one configuration, a consumer's own `cxxflags` stay out of lib's
#      compile, and lib is compiled once for its two consumers there, with
#      the union of the features they ask for (docs/06, "Cargo-style,
#      additive").
#   C. `-p app23b` plans app23b's closure alone: lib is compiled without the
#      feature that only app23 asks for, in the same build directory.
