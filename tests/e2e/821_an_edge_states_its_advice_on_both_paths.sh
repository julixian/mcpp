# 821_an_edge_states_its_advice_on_both_paths.sh -- SPEC-007 R4.5 (the
# 2026-09-28 design, WS3). A build edge that has something to say on success
# writes it to its advice file under the build directory, and mcpp reports it
# once after a successful build, by one function that the full build path and
# the fast path both call. Before 2026.9.28.2 an edge's output was shown only
# when the build failed or under `-v`, so what a successful edge had to say
# reached nobody; and a report attached to one of the two paths appears or not
# depending on whether build.ninja happened to be current.
#
# The edge here is a `check` action that states a note naming its input's
# contents. `place-dlls` is the engine's own writer of this channel, and it
# runs only for PE programs; the rule is the edge's, not the tool's.
#
#   A1  the full path reports the advice once, without -v;
#   A2  after the action's input changes, the build takes the fast path, the
#       edge runs again, and the advice is reported once, with the new text;
#   A3  a build in which the edge does not run reports nothing.
