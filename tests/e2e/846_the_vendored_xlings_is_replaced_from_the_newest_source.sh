#!/usr/bin/env bash
# requires:
# 846 -- a vendored xlings older than the pin is replaced from the newest source
# (mcpp#744).
#
# The check that decides whether to replace the vendored binary took the first
# source that existed -- MCPP_VENDORED_XLINGS, then the xlings released beside
# the running mcpp, then the PATH -- not the newest. A released copy older than
# the pin therefore hid a newer xlings on the PATH, and mcpp stated that no
# newer source was available. One function now chooses: the override when set,
# otherwise the newer of the released copy and the PATH copy.
#
# The stand-in for an older xlings is the ninja payload, whose `--version`
# prints a dotted version older than any dated xlings (as in e2e 687); the
# newer one is the real xlings. Both are real executables, so the criteria
# hold on Windows as well.
#
# Criteria, each from an mcpp running from its release layout
# (`<prefix>/bin/mcpp` beside `<prefix>/registry/bin/xlings`):
#   D. Released older, PATH newer: one `Updating` line naming the PATH, and the
#      vendored binary is then an xlings.
#   E. Released newer, PATH older: the released copy is taken.
#   F. Everything older: one `Note` line, and the vendored binary is kept.
