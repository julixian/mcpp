# 852 -- a repeated `-p` selects every member it names, as a set, and a `-p`
# that names no member is refused before anything is planned.
#
# `-p` was declared with `takes_value()` and without `multiple()`, so a
# repeated `-p` kept the last value and dropped the others without a word
# (mcpp#750): `mcpp build -p a -p b` built `b` alone and exited 0. The
# selection is now one function for every command (member selection design
# 2026-09-30, S1 and S2); the members it returns are a set in `[workspace]
# members` order.
#
# Criteria:
#   A. `mcpp build -p a -p b` in a workspace of `a`, `b` and `c` builds `a` and
#      `b`. `c`'s object directory stays absent.
#   B. `mcpp build -p a -p b` followed by `mcpp build -p b -p a` adds no
#      compile edge to `.ninja_log`: the order `-p` was written in is not part
#      of the selection, and a member named twice is one member.
#   C. `mcpp build -p nosuch` exits non-zero before planning. Its message names
#      `nosuch` and lists the members; a `-p` that is valid beside it does not
#      rescue the command.
