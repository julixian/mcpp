# 218_module_extensions_graph_shape.sh — a declared module extension has to
# behave like a module interface to the two mechanisms that decide WHETHER TO
# REBUILD, not just to the compiler.
#
#  * Part 1 — the freshness fast path must sweep it.
#
#    `sources_newer_than` asks "could the SHAPE of the graph have changed",
#    which is a different question from "did a file change" (ninja answers
#    that one). Its extension list used to be hand-written and did not include
#    `.ixx`, so adding an `import` to one changed nothing it could see: the
#    fast path replayed a stale graph, ninja recompiled the object because its
#    mtime moved, the dyndep edges stayed as they were, and NOTHING reported
#    anything. That is the worst failure mode in this area — silent, and it
#    surfaces later as an unrelated BMI error.
#
#    The edit below adds a real `import`. Do NOT reduce it to `touch`: an
#    mtime-only change is exactly what a correct implementation is also
#    allowed to ignore, so a touch-based test can pass with the bug present.
#    And do NOT delete artifacts to force a rebuild: ninja then fails, the
#    failure is read as a stale-graph signature, and the fast path falls back
#    to a full prepare for the wrong reason — the assertion below would hold
#    while proving nothing.
#
#  * Part 2 — the key must reach the graph.
#
#    `module_extensions` decides which units emit a BMI and which objects link
#    unconditionally. It is an attribute of the package that declares it, not
#    of the configuration (workspace design 2026-09-29 §3): the build
#    directory stays, and the graph written into it must classify the files
#    the key now names. A `.ccm` file the key starts naming becomes a module
#    interface with its own BMI edge, in the same directory.
