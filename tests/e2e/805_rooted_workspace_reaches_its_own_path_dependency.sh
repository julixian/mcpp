# 805 -- a rooted workspace (root [package] + [workspace]) built as itself
# carries its workspace context to a member reached through its OWN [dependencies]
# path entry (mcpp#725).
#
# Before the fix, `state.wsManifest` / `state.runtimeWorkspaceRoot` were left
# unset on this exact branch (src/build/prepare/manifest.cpp), so
# `depIsMember` (src/build/prepare/graph.cpp) read the member as a stranger:
#
#   A. its `x.workspace = true` entry, pinned in [workspace.dependencies] to a
#      version that is NOT the latest, was either refused (2026.9.27.1) or
#      resolved as an unconstrained dependency that happened to land on the
#      latest version anyway (2026.9.26.1) -- the pin must be honoured;
#   B. its omitted `package.version`, supplied by [workspace.package], made the
#      manifest parser itself refuse the member (it was not loaded
#      `insideWorkspace`);
#   C. it received none of [workspace.build]'s flags.
#
# The dependency is served from a project-local path index and pre-extracted
# into the private xlings data directory `install_path_from_project_data`
# reads, so the build touches no network: only the PINNED version (0.0.1) is
# pre-extracted, and the index's "latest", 0.0.2, is not -- so an unpinned
# resolution fails loudly (a network fetch of an https://example.invalid URL)
# rather than silently passing, which is what let 2026.9.26.1 look correct.
