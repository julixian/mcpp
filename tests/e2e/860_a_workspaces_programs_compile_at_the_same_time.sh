#!/usr/bin/env bash
# requires:
# 860 -- the build programs of a workspace are compiled at the same time, up to
# the job count, and run one after another; the failure reported is the first
# in the order they run in.
#
# #748 (B2). A member's program runs after the programs of the members it
# depends on, and that order is kept. Their compiles have no order, and each
# used to wait for the one before it.
#
# Criteria:
#   A. With `-j 4`, the compile intervals of three independent programs
#      overlap. The test compares the timestamps the verbose log records at the
#      start and the end of each compile, not the time the build took.
#   B. With `-j 1`, they do not: each compile ends before the next begins.
#   C. When two programs fail to compile, the failure reported is the first in
#      the order the programs run in, whichever compile finished first. The
#      program that runs second fails at once, and the one that runs first
#      after a slow parse; at `-j 4` the second finishes first.
