# 809 -- a package that declares a device source and whose build.mcpp does not
# compile is described by `emit build-database` with its one real diagnostic,
# `MCPP_BUILD_DATABASE_PROGRAM_FAILED`, not with the device-source orphan
# refusal (mcpp#724 side finding A, design 2026-09-27 §4.2, SPEC-005 R5.2
# amended).
#
# `rules` declares a feature whose `device_extensions`/`rule_module` classify
# `.dev` as a device source when active; `app809` activates it and lists a
# `.dev` file in `[build] sources`, and its own `build.mcpp` is invalid C++.
# The build program never runs, so it applies none of its directives — no
# action claims the device source, which used to read as an orphan and fail
# the whole member (a check whose premise is the program's directives ran
# anyway). Criteria:
#   A. exit status 1.
#   B. `data` is present, and `app809` is described (its manifest, toolchain
#      and module graph do not depend on the failed program).
#   C. the one diagnostic is `MCPP_BUILD_DATABASE_PROGRAM_FAILED`, severity
#      error, `path` "build.mcpp".
#   D. that diagnostic does not mention the device source or the orphan text.
