#
# `[package] mcpp = ">=V"` states the oldest mcpp release a package supports.
# An engine below the floor stops before any other phase, naming the package,
# the floor, its own release and the way to upgrade. The floor is written with
# `>=` only: a bare release means "exactly" elsewhere in mcpp, so it is refused
# with the spelling that is meant. `[workspace.package] mcpp` is inherited by
# members. `[lib]` reports an unknown key, as `[build]` and `[package]` do.
#
#   F1  a floor above this release stops the build with the hint;
#   F2  a floor at or below this release builds;
#   F3  a bare release and a non-release are refused, each with its reason;
#   F4  a workspace floor reaches a member built with -p;
#   F5  `[lib]` names an unknown key.
