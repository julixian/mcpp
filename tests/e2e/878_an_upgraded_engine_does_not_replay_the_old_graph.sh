#
# build.ninja names the engine that wrote it by absolute path: the `$mcpp` rules
# (dyndep, stage, the BMI schedule) and the `__action` wrapper start that
# executable. The emitter assumed that a new engine plans the graph again, "the
# version is in the fingerprint", and no fast path computes a fingerprint: each
# matched the recorded entry by target, profile, cache mode, features and
# toolchain request, and replayed it. After an upgrade that removed the previous
# install, `mcpp build` ran the old graph and every `stage` action failed
# because the program it names was gone; with the old install still present the
# new front end drove the actions of an older engine without saying so.
#
# The record of a build now carries the engine that wrote it, its version and the
# path of its executable (the path the graph uses), and one predicate
# (`admit_recorded_build`) compares it for every fast path.
#
# One program is built with an engine copied to one path, and the same binary is
# then run from another path, which is what a reinstall into another directory
# looks like to the record (the version is unchanged, so the path is what
# differs, and it is the part that breaks the graph).
#
#   A  the engine is moved and nothing else changes: the build succeeds, plans
#      the graph again, and no command of the new graph names the old path;
#   B  after that one build the next is replayed by the fast path again, and a
#      second move together with an edit of a deployed file (an action that
#      starts the engine has to run) succeeds with the new content in place;
#   C  a record written before the engine was recorded declines once (under -v
#      the reason is printed), and the build after it is replayed;
#   D  `mcpp run` is asked the same question, and runs the program;
#   E  a graph that another engine rewrote while the record still names this
#      one (what `--configure-only` from another install does) is not replayed:
#      the graph's own `$mcpp` binding is asked as well.
