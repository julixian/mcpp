# #224: root-anchored inheritance.
#   1. A workspace ROOT declares `[indices] x = { path = "..." }` (a
#      relative path) ONCE. A member with NO [indices] section of its own
#      inherits it and must resolve the relative path against the
#      WORKSPACE ROOT, not `<root>/<member>/...` — otherwise every member
#      would need its own `../`-prefixed re-declaration.
#   2. `[workspace.dependencies] ylib = { path = "..." }` (also relative to
#      the workspace root) is usable by a member via `ylib.workspace = true`
#      — previously `merge_workspace_deps` only propagated `version`, so a
#      path-form workspace dependency was silently dropped and failed to
#      resolve.
