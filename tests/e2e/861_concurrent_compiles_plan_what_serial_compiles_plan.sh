#!/usr/bin/env bash
# requires:
# 861 -- compiling a workspace's build programs at the same time plans exactly
# what compiling them one after another plans.
#
# #748 (B2, criterion D of the issue). The programs are compiled at the same
# time and run in the order they always ran in; each run applies its directives
# to the plan, and the plan is what `build.ninja` states. So the plan, and with
# it the link line, must not depend on which compile finished first.
#
# The workspace below has three libraries with a build program each, `core`, and
# `cli` and `gui` that depend on it, and an application that links all of them.
# Each program states a link flag, so the order the programs' directives were
# applied in is the order of those flags on the application's link line.
#
# Criteria:
#   A. The build at `-j 4` writes the `build.ninja` a build at `-j 1` writes,
#      byte for byte, and the cached directives of every program are the same.
#   B. The `ran` lines of the two builds are the same lines in the same order.
#   C. The link flags are on the link line in the order the programs ran in,
#      dependencies first, at both job counts.
