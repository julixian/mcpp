# 814_the_llvm_row_defaults_to_the_dynamic_crt.sh -- #718: the CRT model is a
# property of the MSVC ABI, not of the compiler. clang++ targeting
# `x86_64-windows-msvc` (the LLVM row) used to receive no CRT model at all and
# always linked the static CRT (#649 E10, inverted at 703); it now receives
# the same model cl.exe does, spelled `-fms-runtime-lib=static`/`=dll`, and
# `toolchain-coupled` (the dynamic CRT, with the toolset's own
# vcruntime140.dll/msvcp140.dll staged beside the artifact) is the default.
#
# This checks the LLVM row's half of that: the default program imports
# vcruntime140.dll and runs from a clean PATH because the file is staged
# beside it; `cxx_runtime = "self-contained"` restores the static CRT and the
# import disappears; switching between the two keeps both std BMIs valid
# (neither clobbers the other); and `mcpp pack` carries the DLL by default
# while `--mode system` records host-coupled instead of refusing.
#
# Read only when the default toolchain here is the llvm row (703's own
# convention): a runner whose default is msvc@system prints that and asserts
# nothing, because the cl.exe cells are covered by the unit property test
# (NinjaBackendPeRuntime.CrtWordIsOneWordEqualOnCompileAndLink) and by
# 180/181.
