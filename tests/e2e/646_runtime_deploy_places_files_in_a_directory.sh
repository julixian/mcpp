#!/usr/bin/env bash
# 646_runtime_deploy_places_files_in_a_directory.sh -- `runtime.deploy` (#615)
# places a runtime file in a directory relative to the executable.
#
# `deploy_files` flattens every entry into the executable's directory, and a
# loader that reads a fixed subdirectory (the Vulkan loader on macOS reads
# `<executable dir>/vulkan/icd.d`) never finds a flattened copy. Asserted:
#   1. the root's entries land at bin/<to>/<file>, and `to = "."` places the
#      file beside the executable; a test binary finds the same layout;
#   2. a dependency's entry resolves `from` against the dependency and lands in
#      the consumer's bin/<to>;
#   3. one file name in two directories is not a collision, and two DIFFERENT
#      sources for one destination are refused at BUILD TIME (mcpp#723,
#      SPEC-007 R4.2), naming every source and the destination -- planning no
#      longer refuses this, because at planning time neither source may exist
#      yet to compare;
#   4. a destination that leaves the executable's directory is refused naming
#      the entry.
