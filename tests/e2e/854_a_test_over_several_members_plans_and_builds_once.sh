# 854 -- `mcpp test` over several members plans once per configuration group
# and builds what the members share once.
#
# `test --workspace` used to plan each member alone (`workspace_fanout_members`
# and `run_tests` once per member), so a member two members use had its build
# program run once per member that reached it, and its features were those of
# one member's closure, not the union across the selection. `build` and `emit`
# already planned a selection once per configuration group and gave each
# member's tests to the plan in `member_targets`; `test` now does the same
# (member selection design 2026-09-30, S4).
#
# Criteria:
#   F. `a` and `b` share `core`, whose build program appends a line to a file
#      under its OUT_DIR on each run; `a` asks for `core`'s feature `extra`.
#      After `mcpp test --workspace` the file has one line (it had two), the
#      plan states its members once, and both members' tests, each named
#      `main`, run and pass.
#   G. After `mcpp build --workspace`, `mcpp test --workspace` adds no compile
#      edge for `core`'s sources and runs `core`'s program no more. The
#      fixture has no dev-dependency, so the test build does not change
#      `core`'s features.
