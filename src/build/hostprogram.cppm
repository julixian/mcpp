// mcpp.build.hostprogram — compiling the bundled `mcpp` module for build.mcpp.
//
// Split out of build_program.cppm for a blunt reason: that file's anonymous
// namespace miscompiles its own neighbours under clang 22.1.8 + C++20 modules
// + -O2. PR#332 established it (an UNUSED `split_ws` was enough to corrupt a
// local vector in `contract_env`), and growing `build_mcpp_module` in place
// reproduced it again — `Segmentation fault: 11` on every macOS build.mcpp
// e2e, in code this change never touched. Mechanism unknown, reproduction
// solid, and the cheap response is to stop growing that namespace.
//
// See .agents/docs/2026-08-02-host-compile-single-producer-design.md §6.2.

// WHAT IS LEFT HERE IS THE TEXT, AND THE COMPILE OF IT IS ELSEWHERE. The bundled
// module's source and the question "does this program import that module" stay;
// `build_mcpp_module` and `build_host_module`, which compiled the module and the
// host modules into each program's own directory, moved to
// mcpp.build.host_module_compile (#748), which keeps them in a store by key.
