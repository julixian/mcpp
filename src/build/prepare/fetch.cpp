// the consuming build, which is the harder direction to debug.
// A NETWORK STEP OF A BUILD, RETRIED — AND IT HAD NO RETRY AT ALL.
//
// A dependency resolved by `git` is fetched on every machine that has not
// cached it, and a transport that hiccups once failed the whole build:
//
//     error: git clone of 'https://github.com/…' failed:
//     Cloning into '/home/runner/.mcpp/git/63269d80b47f71e6'...
//
// — no message from git, which is what a connection that dies mid-transfer
// looks like. Measured twice on 2026-08-23: once in continuous integration and
// once locally as `TLS connect error: … unexpected eof while reading`.
//
// THREE ATTEMPTS, AND THE LAST FAILURE IS REPORTED UNCHANGED. A wrong URL
// and a missing branch fail exactly as a transient fault does, so this cannot
// tell them apart and does not try: a permanent failure costs three seconds and
// produces the message it always did. Hiding a real error behind a retry is the
// worse trade, which is why the count is small and the report is untouched.
//
// BOTH NETWORK STEPS, not one. The first version retried only the clone —
// and a probe with a nonexistent repository failed in ONE second, because the
// step that runs first is `git ls-remote` and it was still bare. A retry on
// half of a path is a retry that reports success at having been added.
//
// `between` runs after a failed attempt: the clone needs the partial directory
// removed, or git's next attempt fails with "already exists and is not an empty
// directory" — a second, different error that says nothing about the first.
