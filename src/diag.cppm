// mcpp.diag — the single sink for user-visible warnings and degradations.
//
// Why this exists: the engine has many branches that do LESS work because a
// precondition was not met (a toolchain lacks a capability, a payload is
// missing, a platform has no equivalent mechanism). Historically those
// branches were silent, or logged at debug level, which is the same thing
// from a user's point of view. The batch invariant is:
//
//   Any branch that does less because a condition was not met MUST either
//   return an error or report through diag::degraded(). log::debug and
//   log::verbose do NOT count as user-visible.
//
// A `degraded` record therefore requires an `impact` string: the author is
// forced to answer "what will the user actually experience?" — the sentence
// that was missing from every silent-degradation bug this channel was
// introduced to prevent.
//
// Ordinary `warning` records (author mistakes, schema drift) carry no impact.
//
// Records are deduplicated and rendered once, at flush(). `--strict` promotes
// degradations to errors in ONE place, replacing the per-site copies of that
// policy that had accumulated across prepare.cppm.
//
// ONE STATEMENT PER FACT PER RUN, ATTRIBUTED TO ITS SOURCE (P4 of the
// 2026-09-28 design, WS3). A `--workspace` build plans every member as a root
// and flushes after each, so a fact that holds for all of them -- a redundant
// word the workspace states, a directory that ships the C++ runtime -- was
// printed once per member: five times for five members. The terminal now
// prints each (domain, text) once per PROCESS; the per-run record, which
// `--strict` counts and `take()` hands to a machine-readable envelope, still
// holds every occurrence, so a machine reader sees each member's.
